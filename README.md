# GOOGLE_APP_RATING---DATA-ANALYSIS
There are more than 3.04 million apps found on Google Play Store. With this
project /article I want you to take you through a journey of analyzing various
apps found on the play store with the help of different python libraries.
Dataset: The dataset is been taken from Kaggle, which can be found in the
attachments.

App rating, reviews, price, and installs have been analyzed against their
respective categories. Dataset has been cleaned and downloaded from
Kaggle.
You must present an entire overview of the relationship between all the
parameters and how do they add to the efficiency of the product. (Compare
the parameters to analyze the profit margins of the application)
